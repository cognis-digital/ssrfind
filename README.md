**Find SSRF-prone sinks and unvalidated URL fetches in code.**

*Tactical Security — fast field tools for authorized testing, triage, and analysis.*

## Why

SSRFIND exists for one job — find ssrf-prone sinks and unvalidated url fetches in code — and does it without a SaaS bill or heavyweight setup.
Single-purpose, scriptable, CI-friendly, self-hostable, and callable by AI agents over MCP.

## Install

```bash
pip install cognis-ssrfind
# or from this repo:
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick start

```bash
ssrfind --version
ssrfind scan .                      # scan the current project
ssrfind scan . --format json
ssrfind scan . --fail-on high       # non-zero exit for CI gates
ssrfind mcp                         # expose as an MCP server (Cognis.Studio / Claude Desktop / Cursor)
```

## Inspiration / prior art

Built in the spirit of **semgrep ssrf**, re-framed for the Cognis approach: single-purpose, self-hostable,
MCP-native, and unified with the rest of the Suite. Missing a credit? Open a PR.

## How it fits the Cognis Neural Suite

`ssrfind` is one of the **100+ tools** in the [Cognis Neural Suite](https://github.com/cognis-digital).
Every tool ships an MCP server, so [Cognis.Studio](https://cognis.studio) agents can call them as scoped capabilities.
